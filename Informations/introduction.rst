Introduction
============

PyEngine was created by LavaPower.

PyEngine relies on PyGame to work. It was made to be
used in 2D games of all types: Platformer, Pong, Casse bricks...

You can find tutorials, examples and documentation of the different classes.

.. note:: PyEngine is still very young and still very limited.
