ProjectWindow
=============

The first window you will see when you launch PyEngine4 is the ProjectWindow.

This window list all the projects of PyEngine4. You can launch a project with a double click.

.. note:: A project made with other version of PyEngine can be launched but may produce problems.

You can also delete an existed project or create a new project with a name, an author and an icon (the last is not obligatory).
