ProjectWindow
=============

The first window you will see when you launch PyEngine4 is the ProjectWindow.

This window list all the projects of PyEngine4. You can launch a project with a doubleclick.

.. note:: An project made with an other version of PyEngine will not be launched.

You can also delete an existed project or create a new projet with a name, an author and an icon (the last is not obligatory).
